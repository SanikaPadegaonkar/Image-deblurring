# Image-deblurring
My submission for Mini Project 2 of the course GNR638 Machine Learning for Remote Sensing II.
## About
Developed a parameter-efficient neural network architecture for image de-blurring. \
◦ Employed an autoencoder architecture for image de-blurring with a 15M parameter limit, achieving a notable
PSNR score of 15.52 dB on the test data despite using only 10% of the available training data. \
◦ Optimized model efficiency by utilizing 14.76M of the 15M allowed parameters, demonstrating potential for
higher performance with additional resources and emphasizing the model’s effectiveness in image de-blurring
